### FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT

# Jammming

### Overview

In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

#### Example Project
![A preview of the Jammming project. A user looks up the name of an artist and adds songs fetched from the Spotify API to a playlist in the Jammming app.](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/react/projects/previews/jamming-project-four-three-preview.gif)

A preview of the Jammming project. A user looks up the name of an artist and adds songs fetched from the Spotify API to a playlist in the Jammming app.

#### Project Requirements
* Build a web app using React
* Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
* Integrate with Spotify or another API
* Deploy your application
* Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
  * The purpose of your project
  * Technologies used
  * Features
  * Future work

#### Features:
* Users can search for songs by song title.
  * You can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
* Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
  * You can also include other information – the design is up to you
*Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account

#### Prerequisites:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* HTTP Requests and Responses
* Authentication

### Setup

#### Going Off Platform
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and Git version control. If you need help setting up your text editor, read our [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code). If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, [review the Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) or look at this [cheat sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/cheatsheet).

#### APIs
We’ve noticed that some learners outside of the United States are unable to create a Spotify account. You are welcome to use any API you want that supports `GET` and `POST` requests. [Other APIs can be found on this page](https://rapidapi.com/blog/top-free-music-data-apis/) or [this page](https://rapidapi.com/collection/music-apis). If you are using an alternate API, you’ll need to adjust the following steps:

* Obtain a Spotify Access Token
* Implement Spotify Search Request
* Save a User’s Playlist

#### Debugging Tips
Feeling stuck? Try the following:

* **Google your question:** Oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Quora to see how other folks have found solutions.
* **Read the documentation:** Make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
* **Rubber ducking:** Try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.

Remember: your project doesn’t have to look anything like this! It should be unique to your vision.

#### Sharing
Great work! Visit [our forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/) to compare your project to our sample solution code. After you host your own solution on GitHub, be sure to share it with other learners and see how other learners have built their own projects!

Your solution might look different from ours, and that’s okay! There are multiple ways to solve these projects, and you’ll learn more by seeing others’ code.
